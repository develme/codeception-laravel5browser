# Codeception Laravel 5 Browser Module

This package provides a Laravel 5 Browser Module for [Codeception](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception).
It is based on the Laravel 5 Module by Jan-Henk Gerritsen that is currently included with Codeception.
This package extends PhpBrowser. So PhpBrowser's url settings needs to be specified.

## Usage
You can use this module as any other Codeception module, by adding 'Laravel5Browser' to the enabled modules in your Codeception suite configurations.
Don't forget to specify an url setting since it uses Codeception's PhpBrowser.
